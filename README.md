NES homebrew to interactively write values to the 2A03 sound registers

Tool previously released as binary only in 2014 here:

And shown in this video:

This includes a VRC6 and FDS variant of the tool, which allows you to switch between sound regions by hitting select on the D-PAD.

The batch files are there as examples. 
If you add nintendulator.exe in the folder where you compile, it will auto start the emulator with the rom you freshly build.
