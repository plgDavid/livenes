NES homebrew to interactively write values to the 2A03 sound registers

Tool previously released as binary only in 2014 here:

And shown in these vids:

This repository also include VRC6,S5B and FDS variants of the tool, which allows you to switch between sound regions by hitting select on the D-PAD.
The S5B is especially badly emulated out there because Gimmick! only uses the 3 tone channels, not the noise nor the envelope.

The batch files are there as examples. 
If you add nintendulator.exe in the folder where you compile, it will auto start the emulator with the rom you freshly build.
