This includes VRC6,S5B and FDS variants of the tool, which allows you to switch between sound regions by hitting select on the D-PAD.

The batch files are there as examples. 
If you add nintendulator.exe in the folder where you compile, it will auto start the emulator with the rom you freshly build.
